The BEAT system makes use of fine-grained permissions to determine who is allowed to do what.
Overall, django implements an admin user, who is able to do anything. Apart from them we have the followwing:

- users who are given 'staff' privileges have access to the admin site
- normal users don't and can only do things which the application has specifically coded
- all users are either:
    nonmembers - who can see the music in the catalogue, search it, and get information about it
    members - who can in addition place reservations on a piece ( if available ), cancel a reservations
        - get a list of what they've reserved or borrowed
    librarians - who can check out a reserved piece as borrowed by a member or returned by them, and can also place
        - a reservation on behalf of a different user and see which user has borrowed a particular instance



In order to implement this, we define the following fine-grained permissions
can_browse_catalog
can_see_availability
can_self_reserve
can_any_reserve
can_issue
can_return
can_see_reservation_detail

We then check these permissions as required on a view-by-view basis
